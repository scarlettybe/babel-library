# Reading & Booklists

Curated lists that **bridge academic themes** with **public-library titles**. Use them for personal learning, reading clubs, or class extensions.

## Canadian History: Foundational Texts
**Scholarly gateway**
- *A Fair Country* — J. Saul (overview of Canadian identity)
- *Canada: A Very Short Introduction* — D. M. Thomas
- (Optional article) JSTOR: “Settler Colonialism in Canada” (add open link if available)

**Public-library picks (accessible)**
- *The Inconvenient Indian* — Thomas King (non-fiction)
- *The Colony of Unrequited Dreams* — Wayne Johnston (novel)
- *Extraordinary Canadians* series (short biographies)

📝 **Why this path works**: start with synthesis → test ideas through memoir/fiction → return to history with new questions.
