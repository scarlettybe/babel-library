# Academic ↔ Public Bridge

Translate academic collections and methods into **accessible reading paths**.

## Open Resources you can use today
- **UBC Open Collections** — digitized photos, maps, newspapers (open access).
- **cIRcle** — UBC’s open repository (theses, articles).
- **HathiTrust / Internet Archive** — out-of-copyright books, some controlled digital lending.

> Only link to **publicly accessible** items. For licensed databases, give method tips (e.g., use campus Wi-Fi, guest stations) but avoid sharing restricted PDFs.

## From Special Collections to Public History
- Start with a **curator blog post** or exhibition page.
- Pull 2–3 concepts (e.g., printing history, women printers, immigrant newspapers).
- Build a **public list** that echoes those concepts with novels/memoirs available locally.

## Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Basics
- If your system doesn’t have a title, ask staff about **ILL**.
- Provide: title, author, year, ISBN/ISSN, preferred pickup branch.
- Expect 1–3 weeks; lendable formats vary.
